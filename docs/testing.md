# Testing Superpowers

Superpowers has two distinct kinds of tests, each in its own directory:

- **`tests/`** — does the plugin's non-LLM code work? Bash + node + python integration tests for brainstorm-server JS, OpenCode plugin loading, codex-plugin sync, and analysis utilities.
- **`evals/`** — do agents behave correctly on real LLM sessions? Python harness driving real tmux sessions of Claude Code / Codex / Gemini CLI, with an LLM actor and verifier judging skill compliance.

## Plugin tests

Live in `tests/`. Currently:

- `tests/brainstorm-server/` — node test suite for the brainstorm server JS code.
- `tests/opencode/` — bash tests for OpenCode plugin loading, bootstrap caching, and tool registration.
- `tests/codex-plugin-sync/` — bash sync verification.
- `tests/kimi/` — bash/Python checks for Kimi plugin manifest wiring.
- `tests/claude-code/test-helpers.sh`, `analyze-token-usage.py` — utilities used by remaining bash tests.
- `tests/claude-code/test-subagent-driven-development.sh` — agent-can-describe-SDD test (no drill counterpart; tests description-recall, not behavior).
- `tests/claude-code/test-subagent-driven-development-integration.sh` — extended SDD integration with token analysis (drill covers the YAGNI subset; bash adds commit-count, Claude Code task-tracking, and token telemetry assertions).
- `tests/claude-code/test-worktree-native-preference.sh` — before/after validation for worktree skill (drill covers the PRESSURE phase; bash also covers baseline and revised fixtures).
- `tests/code-first/test-code-first-policy.sh` — static and structural checks for implementation-before-tests guidance across packaged skills and manifests.
- `tests/code-first/test-writing-skills-validator.sh` — portable validator checks for skill frontmatter, folder naming, and linked references.
- `tests/code-first/forward-eval-scenarios.md` — reusable fresh-agent scenarios for direct implementation, bug fixes, plans, subagent execution, and test-only tasks.
- `tests/code-first/forward-eval-results.md` — recorded fresh-agent outcomes for the current code-first workflow revision.
- `tests/explicit-skill-requests/` — Haiku-specific, multi-turn, and skill-name-prompted tests not covered by drill.

Run plugin tests via the relevant directory's `run-*.sh` or `npm test`.

## Skill behavior evals

Live in `evals/`. Drill is the harness; scenarios live at `evals/scenarios/*.yaml`. See `evals/README.md` for setup. Quick start:

```bash
cd evals
uv sync --extra dev
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-...
uv run drill run worktree-creation-under-pressure -b claude
```

Drill scenarios are slow (3-30+ minutes each) and run real LLM sessions. They are not part of CI today; the natural follow-up is a tiered model (fast subset on PR, full sweep nightly + on-demand).
